Infinity War 2.0 Task
Install the following packages :-



I've used nodejs, expressjs, mongodb and moongoose for building this application.
I have also done google+ authentication using passport.js .
On signup the email and password will be stored in database and on login
it will be checked. 
After login the page with pictures will be displayed.
The pictures are displayed as image slider which can be viewed
using the left and right buttons present.
I have also added an additional feature of uploading any image and that
image will be displayed in the image slider.
These images are stored in mongodb as image using Gridfs.
The front end is developed using bootstrap and JavaScript and i have 
referenced few templates too.
