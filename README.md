#Oauth2.0_Authentication_using_nodejs
Authentication with google oauth2.0
Infinity War 2.0 User Authentication Task.
Server Port: 3000

Ive used the following packages, so install these while testing :-
express,
passport,
mongoose,
path,
multer,
gridfs-stream,
multer-gridfs-storage,
method-override,
dialog.




I've used nodejs, expressjs, mongodb and moongoose for building this application.
I have also done google+ authentication using passport.js.
On signup the email and password will be stored in database and on login it will be checked. 
After login the page with pictures will be displayed.
The pictures are displayed as image slider which can be viewed using the left and right buttons present.
I have also added an additional feature of uploading any image and that image will be displayed in the image slider.
These images are stored in mongodb as image using Gridfs.
The front end is developed using bootstrap and JavaScript and i have referenced a few templates too.
